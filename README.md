Query Quill enables you to build custom-trained RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) models effortlessly. Upload your documents, process them, and perform smart queries with ease. No deep technical expertise required! It‚Äôs all about creating tailored AI assistants that understand and respond based on the specific content you provide.

![QueryQuill](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e95ba28-a58e-470f-843b-786b2f9c7734)

üõ†Ô∏è How It Works:

- üìÑ Document Ingestion
Upload various document types like web pages, PDFs, and raw text. We parse and normalize them for seamless processing.

- üß† Vector Embedding
Your documents undergo semantic analysis using LangChain Models. The high-dimensional vector representations are then indexed in a FAISS database for lightning-fast similarity searches.

- üí¨ Semantic Querying
Utilize natural language processing to interpret your queries, retrieve relevant document segments, and generate context-aware responses through ChatGPT, RAG, and vector search.

üí° Tech Stack:
- Frontend: React & TypeScript, Tailwind
- Backend: Django & PostgreSQL
- AI & ML: FAISS, PyTorch, LangChain
- Other Tools: JWT for authentication, Celery for asynchronous tasks, Redis for caching and message brokering

https://rhythmmusic.netlify.app/

[Backend](https://github.com/hheennrryyb/rhythm-music-server) |
[Frontend](https://github.com/hheennrryyb/rhythm-music)

Rhythm music app was created to discover, share and curate playlists! The app is a full-fledged music app with all the core features of a modern music app, such as account authentication, the ability to save and create shareable links, and most importantly discover tunes from a plethora of genres. Rhythm is also fully responsive for all screen sizes with an intuitive and beautifully sleek UI.

üí° Tech Stack:

**Frontend**
-   React JS
-   Redux Took Kit: Redux was a treat to use to manage states around the complexities of handling music player functionality and user session data after authentication. RTK query was also used to automate data fetching & caching for CRUD playlist functionality. Although I‚Äôve used useContext API before, RTK will be my go-to for state management for every future project for its amazing features.
-   Tailwind: Was entirely done with tailwind, creating the amazing-looking UI.

**Backend**
-   NodeJS, Express: Entire backend was built to handle charts/ genre data, user accounts, shareable links, and many more features.
-   MongoDB, Mongoose: MongoDB/mongoose is used to handle storing all user, playlists, and song data. Users are able to register for an account, save playlists, and many more features using this excellent document oriented database.
-   Becrypt, JWT: Used to help hashing, and authenticating users.

https://locally-capstone.vercel.app/

[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/hheennrryyb/Locally-Capstone)

Locally is my NextJS Ecommerce website centered around giving local boutique handcraft makers an accessible B2C platform. This project was a part of my final capstone project for my time at Brain station. The website is a feature-packed with e-commerce cart and checkout functionality, many dynamic routes and a beautiful UI. The project was a big undertaking considering the short time span I had and the functionality I had to develop for an MVP. Although I gained so much knowledge about new technologies, the app was also fulfilling to create because of the social responsibility and sustainability behind the project. **(2 Weeks to Develop)**

![Locally](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79873814/203249507-2596df34-a533-4ccf-851f-588cb1b8c062.gif)

-   Sanity CMS - was handling all the content on the website without the need for a complex backend. Data were queried using GROQ and using Next function getServerSideProps pre-render the page on each request. Sanity rich text, image handling, and content management were crucial in having a content-heavy website work.
-   UseContextAPI - Context provides a way to share values like these between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree.

## Telus Bubble App - Indecisive? Use Bubbles to Navigate and Pick Your Favourite Shows

TELUS Digital challenged us on developing an application & design to tackle the option paralysis surrounding the multitude of streaming available. The 24 hour hackathon was exhilarating from the ideation process to developing the react app. We are super proud of our innovative app that solves option paralysis creatively and practically. This was a great opportunity to work cross-collaboratively with the UX team for ideation and creative design. Telus also provided a very open challenge that sparked ingenuity and critical thinking to solve a major issue many large companies struggle with. **(24 hour hackathon )**
